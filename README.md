# Coin Pick BetaPlayer

Created with Cocos Creator 3.3.0, following the [Quick-Start first game Tutorial]([[https://docs.cocos.com/creator/manual/en/getting-started/first-game/]]) 


# Obito-game-master Features:
## 1.Player Movement and Jumping:
  The Player class handles player movement and jumping.
  The player can move left (A key) or right (D key).
  Jumping is triggered by pressing the W key.
  The player character jumps with a specified height and duration.
  The player’s speed is controlled by acceleration and maximum move speed.
## 2.Game Logic and Scoring:
  The Game class manages game logic.  
  Stars are spawned at random positions.
  The player collects stars by getting close to them.
  The game keeps track of the player’s score.
  The game ends if the player fails to collect stars within a certain time.
## 3.Star Collection:
  The Star class represents collectible stars.
  Stars have a pick-up radius.
  When the player gets close enough to a star, it triggers collection.
  Collected stars play a sound effect, increase the score, and are destroyed.
## 4.Audio Effects:
  The game includes audio effects for jumping and star collection.
## 5.Scene Management:
  The game scene transitions to a “game over” state when the timer runs out.
  The player node becomes inactive, and the scene reloads.
## 6.Random Star Spawning:
  Stars spawn at random positions within specified bounds.
  The duration between star spawns varies randomly.
